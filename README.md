# IRP: Oilfield Scale Detection with Machine Learning
### Package: Spark DEA (Data Exploration Analysis)

The project is split into two concurrent objectives for investigating oilfield scaling in oilwells 
given large quantitites of oilwell data.
- Develop Python Package to organise, explore, and model provided data in Spark SQL DataFrames
to simplify and reuse Spark DataFrame manipulations and modelling. 
- Utilise Package in an Azure Databricks Notebook Environment to investigate the problem with classified data 
residing in the DataLake.

The repository contains (To be updated):
1. Spark Data Modules
2. Spark Data Tests
3. Example Workflow Notebook
