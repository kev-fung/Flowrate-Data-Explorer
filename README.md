# IRP: Scale Treatment Optimisation with Machine Learning
## Author: Kevin Fung


### In collaboration with Wintershall Dea

This serves as the main repository for uploading and version control.

For background, the main python environment will be Microsoft Azure Notebooks with Spark/Apache Integration.


**Version Control Log History:**

Due to company reasons and data privacy control, version controlling approach may change over time. 
A log below will keep track of these changes.



| Log Date  | Comment |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **09/07/2019** | Committing .ipynb changes to repository from Azure Databricks |
| **11/07/2019** | **[NOTICE]** Discussions with upper management show concerns with data and graphs being shown in notebooks. Talks are still going, but as precaution, notebooks with results from previous commits up to now have been removed. |
| **18/07/2019** | A solution workflow to avoid data exposure has been devised. Any package/module development will be conducted with PyCharm (with Github integration). A bash script has been written for Microsoft Azure Notebooks to import Github repository into the Azure workspace, and can also import packages into notebooks. Notebook states and results will be cleared before pushing to the repository. |
