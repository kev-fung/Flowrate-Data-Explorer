## Data Privacy
Access to data is restricted due to company legalities.

## Installation
The package is designed to run within an Azure Databricks environment.
For local installations, move into the source folder, mlflowrates, then pip install the package.

## Usage
Usage for the software is provided in the form of a notebook, EXAMPLE.ipynb, to allow users to understand how to use the code.

| **09/07/2019** | <ul><li>Committing .ipynb changes to repository from Azure Databricks</li></ul> |
| **11/07/2019** | <ul><li>**[NOTICE]** Discussions with upper management show concerns with data and graphs being shown in notebooks. Talks are still going, but as precaution, notebooks with results from previous commits up to now have been removed.</li></ul> |
| **18/07/2019** | <ul><li>A solution workflow to avoid data exposure has been devised. Any package/module development will be conducted with PyCharm (with Github integration). </li><li>A bash script has been written for Microsoft Azure Notebooks to import Github repository into the Azure workspace, and can also import packages into notebooks.</li><li>Notebook states and results will be cleared before pushing to the repository.</li></ul> |
