# Oilfield Scale Detection with Machine Learning
### Developed Package: SparkDEA (Data Exploration Analysis)

This project aims to investigate the scaling of oilwells and its detection given large quantitites of well data.
The first concurrent objective is to develop a Python Package to organise, explore, and model data in Spark SQL DataFrames to simplify and reuse relevant data methods typically used in a data engineering and science workflow.
The second concurrent objective is to use the package in an Azure Databricks Notebook Environment to investigate the problem 
with classified data residing in the DataLake.

This repository contains (To be updated):
1. Spark Data Modules
2. Spark Data Tests
3. Example Workflow Notebook
